# Project_continuous_functions_nowhere_differential

Construction of a generator of continuous function nowhere differentiable (Weierstrass Function) in Python (fractal behavior). Proof of existence. Baire Lemma's application : proof of density in continuous functions ensemble functions. 

This repository explores continuous nowhere differentiable functions, a fascinating class of functions that are continuous everywhere but lack a derivative at any point. These functions challenge traditional calculus concepts and are examples of "rough" or "irregular" behavior in mathematical analysis. The project includes a Python script to visualize such functions, providing insights into their unique properties and appearance.

## Contents

- **Python Script**: Code to generate and visualize examples of continuous nowhere differentiable functions, such as the Weierstrass function or random Brownian motion paths.
- **Examples**: Several examples and parameters for generating different types of nowhere differentiable functions.

Notebook: An interactive Jupyter notebook explaining the mathematical background and allowing users to experiment with generating these functions.

## Mathematical Background

Continuous nowhere differentiable functions are known for being continuous (smooth in terms of not having breaks or jumps) but nowhere differentiable, meaning the rate of change is undefined at every point. Examples of such functions include:

  - Weierstrass Function: A classic example of a continuous nowhere differentiable function defined by a sum of sine or cosine functions with particular frequencies and amplitudes.
  - Brownian Motion (or Wiener Process): A stochastic process that models random paths and exhibits continuity without differentiability.

## Requirements

This project requires Python and the following libraries:

- matplotlib and plotly (for plotting)
- numpy (for numerical operations)

## Usage

Clone the repository:
    
    git clone https://github.com/Aurelp84/Continuous_Nowhere_Differentiable_Functions.git


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to add new examples of nowhere differentiable functions, optimize the script, or enhance the visualizations.
